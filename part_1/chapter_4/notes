Containers and Algorithms

Standard library provide standard types
standard library takes up 2/3rd of the ISO C++ standard
Standard library provides facilities for runtime support like allocations, the C std lib,
strings and io streams, containers, algorithms, numerical computation, regex matching, concurrency,
template programming, smart pointers.

In short, stdlib contains common fundamental data structures along with algorithms used on them.

strings. C++ strings are mutable (as opposed to ones you might have encountered in python). You can utilize
the [] operator to change a string.

io of built-in types is straight forward. cout and cin from the iostream library can intake all built-in types.
iostream also allows developers to define IO for their own types.

container is a class with the main purpose of holding objects.
Entry class shown earlier is a container.
Vector is the most useful standard library container. Its a sequence of elements of a given type, 
stored contiguously in memory. This gives it O(1) access time for any element since you hold
a starting pointer plus an index. Single access with no list walking.
