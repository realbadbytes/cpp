The purpose of programming is to express ideas in code.
The purpose of a programming language is twofold:
    - provide a vehicle for development and execution
    - provide a set of concepts for problem solving

C++ provides
    - direct mappings of built-in operations and types to hardware for efficiency
    - abstraction mechanisms for user-defined type creation with same support and performance as built-in types

EFFICIENCY and ELEGANCE

TIL: C++ was originally from the convergence of Simula and C.

C++ most directly supports 3 programming styles:
    - Procedural: processing and design of suitable data structures
    - Data abstraction: hiding implementation details
    - Object-oriented: class hierarchies, runtime polymorphism
    - Generic: algorithms that accept N types, template programming


lvalue is reliable, something located at a trustworthy location
rvalue is more transient, may or may not change or be there when you want it again

The difference between C and C++ is primarily the degree of emphasis on types and structure.

C++ is a language that you can grow with.

How to write good code?
    - Know what you want to express
    - Practice, imitate good code
